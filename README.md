# Nessus Report Generator

In today's complex landscape of information systems and networks, combating security vulnerabilities is becoming increasingly challenging. As a result, security experts and system administrators often conduct vulnerability scans to assess system security and identify potential weaknesses. In this context, the results obtained using Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanning tool, need to be reported in a meaningful and effective manner. This project has been developed to address this need by taking the scanning results in CSV format produced by Nessus and transforming them into a user-friendly PDF report.

## Project Features:

### Importing CSV Data:
The project imports data in CSV format generated by Nessus, reading and storing this data for later use in creating reports.

```python
data1 = pd.read_csv("sample.csv"))
```

### Data Analysis and Processing:
Various analyzes and processes are performed on the imported data. During this stage, crucial information related to the overall security status of the system is extracted, and vulnerabilities are prioritized.

### Creating Graphs and Tables:
Based on the acquired data, the project generates various graphs and tables. These visuals assist the user in quickly understanding the security situation and presenting it visually.

### Generating PDF Reports:
In addition to graphs and tables, the project creates a detailed PDF report based on the analyzed data. This report provides comprehensive information to the user about the security status of the system.

### Customizability:
The project is designed with a customizable structure to meet the user's needs. Users can personalize the content and appearance of the report, filter out unnecessary information, and change the prioritization as needed.
```python
    filtered_data1 = data1[data1['Risk'].isin(['Critical','High'])]
    risk_counts = filtered_data1['Risk'].value_counts()
    risk_table = pd.DataFrame({'Risk Severity': risk_counts.index, 'Count': risk_counts.values})))
```
